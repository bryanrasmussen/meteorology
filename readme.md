## Quick start

1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/bryanrasmussen/meteorology.git`
2. Move to the appropriate directory: `cd meteorology`.<br />
3. npm install
4. We have a build script that uses browserify on the command line so install browserify with npm install -g browserify if you don't already have it.
5. do npm run-script build this should build both webpack and browserify built. We should end up with a build output in the dist folder. 
6. npm start will start it up
7. go to localhost:3000 to see it working.
